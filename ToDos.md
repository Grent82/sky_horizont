# ToDo and Ideas

## Ideas
* each character has its own credits
    * get credits by planets (steuern handel) oder durch überfälle

* prisoners of war, captured on planets or space battles
* consider time of conquest battle in hours depends on strength of both opponents
* Ensures that loot flows and political influence hierarchies feel meaningful, incentivizing hierarchical chain-of-command dynamics
*  expand to capture civilians or family members for ransom as additional loot flows, but keep character and role-based share logic separate

## ToDos
* Domain events broadcasting conquest progress to UI or simulation loop.
* integrate real planet tax revenue logic
* refine combat-to-economy mapping further
* Add features like upkeep tax draining maintenance costs.
* Implement more personality-driven economic modifiers (e.g. Diplomatic trait boosting tax rates).
