A simple Utility score = weight*(personality facet + current need + relationship/opinion + faction orders).


 example social events: CourtshipSucceeded, InsultPublic, BribeAccepted, DefectionAttempted, BlackmailExposed.



 conversation :  Use Big Five shortcuts (e.g., Agreeableness ↑ success for Plead; Extraversion+Openness ↑ for Flirt; Conscientiousness + Rank for Bargain/RequestAid).



 Pirates keep prisoners on fleets; ransom/affection already per turn works—just ensure fleets expose CapturedCharacterIds.
Add Hostaging as an intrigue mechanic: factions can buy captives to flip them, recruit them, or trigger prisoner exchanges.

If you follow that order — SocialGraph → IntentPlanner → Interactions → Intrigue → Diplomacy—you’ll quickly get emergent relationship drama that feeds directly into espionage, defections, and wars…which then feeds back into your battles and economy. Very space‑sim, very replayable.




Expand plot outcomes into real use-cases (prisoner exchange, sabotage to fleets/planets, leak military disposition).
Make exposure interact with your Morale or Battle layers (e.g., exposed coup reduces Stability on a planet).


Tasks:
A cooldown or fatigue system integrated with characters.
Task chains (dependencies) so a success auto‑spawns a follow‑up task.
